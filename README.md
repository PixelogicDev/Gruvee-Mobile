## 🎸 What is Grüvee?

Grüvee is an open source, social, collabortive playlist made by the [PixelogicDev Twitch Community](https://twitch.tv/pixelogicdev). This project is being made live on Twitch with help from chat and contributions via Pull Requests!

## 🤔 Why use it?

Grüvee is being created to make sharing music an easier and more personal experience with others. While at the same time, getting around the plethora of music streaming platforms out there. Grüvee does this by addressing the following concerns:

-   🎵 `Different Music Services`: Grüvee will give you the opportunity to collaborate on playlists with people that don't share the same music streaming service as you! Behind the scenes, Grüvee will make sure you are all in sync with your favorite platform.
-   💬 `Discussions`: Talk about what gets your HYPED about certain songs and save that thread with your friends! Grüvee will keep track of your comments on a per song basis.
-   🔔 `Notifications`: Get notified when people in your Grüvee Playlist do something! It's funny how major providers don't even notify you when people add new songs to your collaborative playlists. Grüvee is here to change that.
-   🔊 `Show Off Your Music Taste`: Music is an expression of ourselves. Grüvee is focused around how to you express your love and passion for music in a way that is fun and inspiring.
